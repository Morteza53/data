Readings will comprise a variety of fiction and non-fiction genres. Authors may include Dostoevsky, Unamuno, Camus, Sartre, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Brecht, Kafka, Pirandello, Weil, and Beckett."
95,BHP 227,"Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Age of Empire","This course examines the history and literature of British and American imperialism from 1890 to the present, focusing on the intersections of race, gender, class, and sexuality. The course will cover themes of national identity, representations of colonized peoples, and imperialism as a cultural project. The history of imperialism as understood through literary and cultural analyses will focus on the functioning of gender, sexuality, and race in the ideologies and strategies of imperialism and anti-imperialism and in the psychological impact of colonial rule. Overall, we will consider how such analyses can inform a (re)defining of the colonial project."
96,BHP 240,Chemistry and Conflict,"Chemistry and other sciences have radically changed the conduct of war and mechanisms of
human conflict. Using case studies from the Chemical Revolution to present day, this course
examines how knowledge of matter altered warfare – in terms of its scale, its boundaries, and its
meaning. To this end, we study Antoine Lavoisier’s work with gunpowder in the 18 th century
alongside a more famous case of wartime chemistry: Fritz Haber’s development of chemical
weapons during World War I. We also study the Manhattan Project, which produced the world’s
first atomic bomb in the final days of World War II. Secondly, this course investigates the many
legacies of these new weapons. We follow the development of the military-industrial complex,
the use of war chemicals as pesticides, and the deployment of Agent Orange in Vietnam. Finally,
we examine more recent uses of chemical weapons, including in Japan, Iraq, and Syria.
Throughout the course, students will bring knowledge of chemistry to bear on these historical
episodes. They will demonstrate how knowledge of key chemical principles – such as atomic
structure, bonding, and reactivity – help to contextualize the development of modern war."
97,BHP 251,Idea to Innovation,"The pharmaceutical industry comprises an incredibly diverse team of thinkers, including accountants and biochemists, who are all on a quest to improve human health.  The development of medical treatments relies on pivotal insights from the scientific laboratory, but turning these ideas into practical medical innovations requires the solving of many problems outside of the scientific field.  Through the examination of historical and contemporary case studies, this course will investigate the nature of science as it is practiced in the real world.  How are problems identified and ideas generated and refined?  What political and sociological challenges does the industry encounter?  Who pays for all of this?  By exploring growth in the pharmaceutical industry from the inside, students in this class will gain a deeper understanding of both science and business and how these disciplines interact in order to enhance and extend human life."
98,BHP 252,Creativity and Design Thinking,"Creative, interdisciplinary, and collaborative work is being recognized as increasingly important for innovation and solving global problems of the 21st century. This course will introduce students to a much-needed framework for dealing with unstructured problems for creative problem solving, and a process for innovation. The course consists of two related parts: the psychology of creativity provides a foundational basis of knowledge and discussion, and the design thinking framework serves as an example of a powerful creative thinking strategy that an increasing number of individuals and organizations have used successfully over the past decade."
99,BHP 253,A Cross-Cultural Comparison of Play,"This course examines how children from two different countries – the United States and Japan – play, and analyzes the influences of factors such as parents, environment, school, and culture. If travel is permitted, students will directly observe children at play in several different locations in each country – including (but not limited to) playgrounds, schools, play therapist’s offices, museums, indoor play places, zoos, and theme parks. Interviews with parents, teachers, therapists, and potentially children themselves will help to clarify how play is viewed and practiced in each culture. Readings on the evolution of play, the benefits of play, the practical applications of play (e.g., in education and in therapy), and cultural differences in play will be used to support and help to inform the data students will collect through the interviews and observations."
100,BHP 259,Honors Seminar: The Environment: a Conflict of Interest,"Examines critical environmental issues such as global warming; food, water and energy resources; population trends; and global industrialization.

101,BHP 261,The Online Explosion: Radical Changes in Business and Communication,"Compared to a world just one generation ago when business people composed memos on typewriters and communicated with fax machines, the online explosion has brought forward a flood of new communication tools and social media platforms. It has created new types of businesses that would have been unimaginable just a short time ago and has revolutionized the way people communicate, socialize, and shop. The explosion of the web has also led to work environments in which employees are always “connected,” and has raised concerns about personal privacy.  We will guide students through a critical evaluation of these radical changes, with an eye on their benefits as well as potential negative consequences."

104,BHP 281,The Rhetoric of Science,"This course will examine the rhetoric of science in an effort to see how science has used language and various text types to answer questions, resolve disputes, and legitimize the knowledge contained within its disciplinary borders, and conversely how language and communication have guided scientific discovery throughout history.  Reading texts from ancient and contemporary scientists, philosophers, historians, and literary authors, we will identify the key linguistic and rhetorical traits employed within the discourse communities of modern science, and consider consequences of—and the scientific developments enabled by—such language and textual practices. These concepts will be emphasized and elucidated vis-à-vis some of the most significant scientific and medical discoveries impacting the modern world."
105,BHP 290,"Shakespeare: Page, Stage & Screen","This course aims to explore, in depth, the translation of Shakespeare’s texts into performance by combining theatre history, cinematic adaptation, and textual analysis with a strong emphasis on practical, creative, and collaborative work. We will study 5 plays over the course of the semester and consider each as a performance piece as well as a literary artifact. Each play will be examined from multiple perspectives that are theatrical/performative/cinematic (staging, costume, sets, dramaturgy, camera, editing) as well as literary (historicist, psychoanalytic, gender and sexuality focused, Marxist, eco-critical, post-colonial), thereby bridging the artificial divide between Shakespeare as literature and Shakespeare as performance."
106,BHP 301,The Law and Racial Progress,"This course is designed to enhance knowledge of the ways in which racial progress intersects with the law. Different areas of the law are emphasized, as well as the criminal justice system, with an emphasis on understanding the role and behavior of different stakeholders and participants in these areas.

107,BHP 302,Mirrors of the Mind: The Interplay of Literature and Psychology,"In exploring the longstanding and evolving partnership between literature and psychology, this course addresses the following questions: How does understanding of psychological theory enhance our reading of literature? How does reading of literature affect our judgements and our responses to real-world situations? How can literary texts aid psychologists in refining theories explaining human behavior? Readings include classics, as well selections by recent writers and theorists representing both disciplines. Among the themes typically discussed are struggles in achieving stage-salient goals in life (separation from parents during adolescence and beginning the assumption of adult roles, etc.); complexities in social interactions (familial, romantic, etc.); the development of empathy; perceptions of self and other; loss and grief, morality; and the influence of culture on personality and behavior."
108,BHP 305,Inclusive Education and Representations of Disability,"This course explores how literature, film, television, and other media (i.e., podcasts, blogs, etc.) portray disability in ways that contribute to –or challenge– clinical concepts.

The Music & Social Justice course is designed for students interested in learning how music can engage and advocate for those on the margins of society. Music can provoke and impact social justice movements, which address moral and social problems and allow society to be more equitable, responsive, and inclusive. In other ways, music can also be a response to the current climate, allowing those impacted by social justice movements to express how they think and feel. This course will examine different periods in history, on both a US and global scale, and the impact of music on social movements, specifically including its influence on African Americans in the US, feminism, and global social issues."
112,BHP 340,Nature and Nurture,Nature and Nurture explores questions of innate and environmental influences on who we are.

113,BHP 351,"Genocide, Human Rights & Literature","This course is designed to introduce students to one of the most troublesome and unnerving aspects of the modern world: the systematic cleansing and killing of populations defined by ethnicity, nationality, or race. Genocide is a contested term, and we will explore its various meanings. The course will concentrate on genocides and crimes against humanity in the 20th century. We will discuss the meaning of key terms like human rights, humanitarianism, and genocide, and investigate particular cases of mass atrocities, starting with the Holocaust and a number of historic cases of genocide, e.g., the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and focus on contemporary atrocities in Rwanda, ex-Yugoslavia, and Darfur. We will also explore the historical process of establishing human rights standards, and examine critically some of the recent efforts at redress, justice, and memory through criminal tribunals, truth and reconciliation commissions, and restitution. A central question runs through the course: how are these two polar opposites, human rights and genocide, related? Do modern forms of thinking about politics and the diversity of human society enable and encourage both phenomena? We will also examine literary and cinematic representations of genocides and mass atrocities. Readings include a variety of literary and cinematic works: novels, poems, graphic novels, memoirs, and film. How have literary and cinematic writers responded to and represented these “unspeakable” events?."

These factors will then be considered in terms of their effects upon the place and actions of the civilization in global politics."
944,GLS 318,Global Political Film,"Political films are a powerful form of political communication. This power derives from the ability of the filmmaker to control the characters, plot, dialogue, setting, and other aspects of the context in which the political message is delivered. It is difficult to conceive of any other form of political communication in which the individual or individuals presenting the message have so much control. Even the most programmed of political events or “photo opportunities” provide instances where outside factors or events may intervene. Further, audiences who watch a film are willing to suspend disbelief for the period of viewing; as such, the filmmaker has a willing participant in the narrative he or she develops. Since political communication is the primary means by which political reality is constructed, and since films provide a very persuasive visual and auditory means of creative narratives, they are important subjects for study and analysis. Nearly all scholars recognize the importance of film as a means of affecting, and reflecting, the political climate of a society, especially during specific historical eras. President Woodrow Wilson, upon first seeing Birth of a Nation, said it was like “watching history written in lightning”; by contrast, James Baldwin referred to the film as “an elaborate justification for mass murder.” Both recognized the persuasive powers of film and its potential propaganda value."

This is a question that has troubled IR for decades. While feminist debates engaged people in spaces outside the disciplines of political science and particularly IR, IR scholars did their best not to see the relevance of feminism for their own debates. That did not stop some feminists from rethinking key IR concepts like power, race and the state, but such contributions were largely ignored by IR scholars until very recently. It was only in the last decades, when feminist questions pushed their way onto the IR agenda through books, journals, and conferences, that feminism suddenly seemed attractive to IR scholars.

But the state has always found ways to justify some interventions in citizens’ private lives, including legislation of abortion and homosexuality. The personal has always been political, as second-wave feminists rightly insisted in the 1960s. This course examines the intersection of private and public, looking at the ways in which sex, identity and sexuality are implicated in and shaped by politics and policy-making: including the gendered division of labor inside and outside the home; the politics of gender identity; the legislation and policing of sex, sexuality, marriage and families; and the challenges facing women who enter politics. We will ask provocative and pressing questions like: How do sex and sexuality intersect with race, class, disability, and more? Can women (or anyone) really “have it all”? What is the future of transgender rights in the U.S.? Why do women still make up only 20% of Congress? Do women lead differently? To answer these questions, we will turn to political theory, political science, public policy, legal studies, and more."

How can we harness the potential of global cooperation to solve problems that cross national borders? We will critically analyze the potential for human rights to protect vulnerable individuals, including victims of human trafficking. We will also evaluate the distribution of global resources and costs, including natural resources, extreme poverty and environmental degradation. What do we owe those who live in distant lands? Throughout we will ask how reality matches up to our best hopes for the present and future."
1587,POL 304,"Political Behavior: Fear, Risk and Crisis","The course focuses on various analytical approaches in behavioral political science. It does so by advancing students' knowledge of the cognitive aspects of whether citizens engage in various types of political behavior-e.g., voting/non-voting, the formation of political partisanship and ideology, issue perceptions, responding to risk and uncertainty in the political environment, and engaging in civic political participation. Note: This course is cross-listed as HLS 304. Students may not get credit for both POL 304 and HLS 304."
1588,POL 305,Political Parties and Electoral Behavior,"The structure, character, and functions of U.S. political parties and pressure groups, and their impact on public policy. Parties are analyzed within the broader scope of organizational theory and comparative party systems. Major emphases on their historical origins, their role in contemporary political life, and particular aspects of party politics--local organization, membership, campaigning and elections, policy-making roles, and leadership."
1589,POL 306,American Political Film,"This course analyzes the structure, history, and impact of the genre of political film. It begins with a discussion of how one distinguishes a political film from other forms of cinema. It then proposes insights into the manner in which these films evoke a particular time and place in politics, affect the viewer’s interpretation of a political event or figure, and have an effect upon a viewer’s political perceptions or behavior. The student will also learn to review films critically, both as political statements and as effective (or ineffective) conveyors of political messages."
1590,POL 307,Political Communication,"The meaning and uses of political communication are examined, the manner and forms such communication takes, and the history of political discourse. Major topics include the role of communication in elections and the development of public policy, how political communication strategies have changed with the rise of mass media, and the development of national and international publics for discourse."
1591,POL 308,Capitalism and Inequality,"This class is about market economies: how they are theorized, how they operate, and how they affect the humans who live and work within them. The first part of this course offers an overview of major modern theorists of capitalism (with selections chosen for a political science audience), including Smith, Veblen, Schumpeter and Keynes. These thinkers have made influential contributions to debates about the proper role of government in regulating and shaping economic relations and conditions. We then turn to contemporary theories of distributive justice, including libertarianism and egalitarianism. The second half of the course explores realities of socioeconomic inequality, the experience of poverty in the U.S., as well as the kinds of policies which might alleviate or resolve various dimensions of inequality and poverty. This course prepares students to evaluate public policies and articulate policy positions while attending to their economic and human costs."
1592,POL 310,Political Psychology and Human Nature,"The 2016 presidential campaign season saw a marked increase in partisanship, polarization, animosity and resentment among Americans, mirroring a worldwide trend toward “tribalistic” group identification at the expense of outsiders. Why can’t we all just get along? What makes it so hard to sympathize with those who seem different or unfamiliar, and so easy to assume the worst about them? This course will bring together classic political theory, psychology and the social sciences, in order to help explain political beliefs and behaviors. We will begin by considering how classic political theory has conceptualized human nature, and the various implications for political life. We will then consider scientific perspectives: evolutionary anthropology, social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We will examine the role of bias in cognition and politics and we will critically interrogate assumptions about rationality. We will also see that different psychological dispositions underlay conservatism and liberalism. Ultimately, this course will consider how these features of human cognition shed light on partisanship and polarization, racial bias, and policy preferences, including popular reception of science concerning vital issues such as climate change and the safety of GMOs. We will conclude with considerations of how a better understanding of psychology might propel us toward a more productive political discourse."
1593,POL 311,Borders and the State,"Borders have a prominent place in politics and human history. In the twentieth century, the best-
known barriers were the militarized Maginot Line and the Iron Curtain. Today, the political popularity of
borders persists but the nature and quality of these borders and the threats they were created to repel
have changed. Modern borders are designed not to keep militaries out, but to deter a perceived
invasion of “undesirables”—with terrorists and unwanted immigrants leading the list of state concerns.
Nowhere is this more evident than along the geographic fault lines dividing rich and poor regions, e.g.
the Mediterranean Sea and the U.S.-Mexican border region. This course will examine the dynamic
interactions between the question of how to govern borders and the twenty-first century liberal
state with its diluted sovereignty— due to immigration, trade and international laws and regimes."
1594,POL 312,Congressional Politics,"An intensive analysis of the legislative process in the United States, considering both the internal organization and operation of Congress, and Congress’ role in the broader American political system.

Particular attention is paid to the role of the US government being able to balance individual rights and liberties within the national security state. Last, the course also takes an in-depth analysis of the U.S. Congress, looking comparatively at how legislatures in other nations have dealt with crafting their own security policies. The course will address the following questions: First, what is the role of Congress in national security policy, what does it do, and why? Second, what are the various ways of studying the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of government in the US system as it relates to the Global War on Terror?  Note: This course is cross-listed as HLS 314. Students may not get credit for both HLS 314 and POL 314."

1599,POL 317,Model United Nations,"Model United Nations (POL 317) is the course that prepares Rider University’s award-winning Model United Nations (MUN) team for the annual National MUN competition in New York City. The team has brought home top awards for the past decade and continuously strives for excellence. POL 317 is a student-led course that hones writing, public-speaking and researching skills of student-delegates and it represents student engagement at the highest level.  Chosen through a rigorous selection process in the fall semester, the student-delegates write position papers during the winter break, and develop caucusing, team-working, and presentation skills in class during the spring semester. During the past five decades, Rider University’s MUN team has represented more than 50 countries, and competed with thousands of delegates from national and international universities. It is one of the premier engaged learning and cohort-building institutions on campus."
1600,POL 318,Conflict Resolution,"How do you craft a peace deal in a war-ravaged environment? Can negotiations with rogue regimes succeed and prevent the onset of conflict? With massive casualties, and unspeakable human rights abuses, conflicts continue to present a challenge to people around the globe. In this course, we will explore the dynamics of conflict management designed to keep countries from waging violence against each other. Our focus is both on ending existing violent conflicts and on preventing escalation of tensions. We will explore the impact of mediators and external interventions by international organizations or individual countries on conflict management. We will also examine the role of the International Court of Justice in resolving disputes when direct negotiations fail to succeed. Finally, we will study existing peacebuilding efforts designed to improve relations among victims and killers in post-conflict environment.  Insights from theory on commitment problems will help us understand why peace is more vulnerable in domestic than in international conflicts. Throughout the semester, we will rely on various case illustrations from international and domestic conflicts, and participate in a simulation activity that will allow us to assume the roles of negotiators in disputes."
1601,POL 319,"Terrorism, Revolutions and Political Violence","Revolutions are the mad inspiration of history. Trotsky’s characterization calls attention to three important dimensions of violent political participation: the historical settings, ideology, and emotional fervor of the practitioners. The course focuses on these dimensions by analyzing revolutionary and terrorist movements in the 20th century. Special attention is given to the use of violence in the post-Cold War new world disorder."

1604,POL 322,African Politics,"Africa is in a process of transition, a continent of growing strategic importance to the U.S. and a land with considerable variation in political and economic success. The course is an introduction to the politics of sub-Saharan Africa. To understand the continent’s current challenges, the course examines the legacies of colonial rule, including colonial mark on the politics of ethnicity; focuses on the rise of authoritarianism in Africa in the 1970s and 1980s; examines the success and failure of democratization that is transforming the continent today; embarks on the quest to understand the continent’s struggle with poverty and debt. Lastly, the course explores some of the biggest obstacle to Africa’s stability, including state collapse, wars, corruption, while contemplating the future that lies ahead."

Emphasis on analyzing policy problems and on developing and evaluating proposed solutions."
1608,POL 328,Environmental Politics,"Environmental Politics examines how policymakers deal with the political challenges of unsustainable resource consumption, which is a primary determinant of environmental problems such as climate change, adverse health effects, and biodiversity loss. The course introduces students to environmental politics and policies at the local, state, national, and international levels. The course is designed to provide students with a framework for understanding how varied interests compete within political institutions in order to transform contending ideas into public policy. With that in mind, students will not only become more informed consumers of political information, but will also become more effective at analyzing and advocating for policies as it relates to the environment."
1609,POL 329,Comparative Environmental Policy,"Comparative Environmental Policy analyzes cross-national approaches in developing, implementing, and evaluating policy responses to environmental problems.

1611,POL 331,Political Corruptions,"This course will introduce students to one of the central political issues in the USA as well as abroad: corruption. Whereas this was considered in earlier days as ‘ temporary malady’ of third world systems, today it is considered a pervasive phenomenon in democratic systems as well . As such it acquired widespread scholarly as well as public attention in established democracies such as the USA (at least since the elections of 2016 ). The course will utilize a range of approaches to examine the meaning of corruption, the link between what the law defines as corruption and what is understood by the term by broad publics, the interaction between both conceptions and system legitimacy, and the methods by which corruption may be contained."

The development of the ideologies of liberalism, conservatism, and libertinism are also covered."
1616,POL 345,Ancient Political Theory: Justice,"The existence of society over time requires high degree of predictability and hence laws, whether explicit or implicit.  These derive their capacity to regulate life from the widespread notion that they are proper and that they should be obeyed.   In a word, they accord to our notions of justice.  These, however, are not stable. Resting on the understandings of man, society, nature and the relations between them, they develop under the impact of human thought and changing realities.  The result is what can be compared to a layered cake. This course treats some of the main contributions made by philosophers from Plato to Rawls to our concept of justice and the manner by which they have shaped our concepts of justice in the US and West in general.   Cases in which courts (mainly the US Supreme Court) made use and applied the thinking of earlier philosophies of justice will illustrate the process by which we adjust the boundaries between legality and criminality and determine how we should behave towards each other."
1617,POL 346,The Politics and Ethics of Emergencies,"This course examines historic and present day cases, ranging across Europe and the US, in which liberal democratic governments, under stress because of subversion, sabotage, invasion, rebellion, or the effects of economically caused chaos, take on emergency powers to become so-called “states of exception.”  While in some cases such states have imposed mild and limited emergency measures, others have employed more draconian measures, suspending, if not dissolving, constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties, often for indeterminate and protracted periods.  How various states have behaved in emergency situations will be the major content of this course. Note: This course is cross-listed as HLS 346. Students may not get credit for both HLS 346 and POL 346."
1618,POL 350,U.S. Foreign Policy and Security Policy,"Principles, institutions, and processes involved in the formulation and implementation of policies regarding the nation’s military, economic, and environmental security within the global framework.

1621,POL 363,Human Rights in Global Context,"Human rights – droits de l’homme, derechos humanos, Menschenrechte, “the rights of man” – are, literally, the rights that one has because one is human. What does it mean to have a right? How are being human and having rights related? This course provides an introduction to theory and global practice of human rights. Human rights claims play an increasingly central role in political and social struggles across the world. The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 signaled a proliferation of international human rights law and transnational non-governmental activism. While the promotion of human rights has become global, adherence to those standards remains highly uneven and gross violations and atrocities continue to occur. Given the breath and complexity of the human rights movement, including its engagement with law, politics and morals, in radically different cultures, this course is by its very nature multidisciplinary. Note: This course is cross-listed as HLS 363. Students may not get credit for both HLS 363 and POL 363."
1622,POL 365,Politics of the Developing World,"Studies the major political issues of the so-called ""developing"" world.

1623,POL 367,Global Immigration,"This course analyzes mass migrations and refugee movements and what they mean for the stability of nations, the increasing potential of severe culture clashes within societies, and the root causes of (forced) migration movements, such as problems of violence, terror and genocide, as recently seen in Darfur, Rwanda and Bosnia. In certain European countries the frequently failed integration and assimilation policies resulted in an Islamic alienation; terrorist attacks and race riots are some of the consequences. Particular attention will be given to the conflict between the refugees’ and migrants’ needs that result from violent, socio-economic or ecological catastrophes in the countries of origin and the various forms of reception within the host countries. Students will explore theoretical, political, legal, and socio-economic dimensions of the refugee and immigration phenomena in a global world.

This course employs both theoretical and practical approaches in its examination of international organizations."
1625,POL 371,The Arab-Israeli Conflict,"The course will begin by introducing the main players: the neo-patrimonial Arab regimes on the one hand, and the democratic, economically modern Jewish sector in Palestine on the other. The analysis will focus on the impact of the social, economic, political and religious differences between the sides on their conception of the conflict among the participants and powers outside the region. The course will concurrently examine the impacts of the dynamics of the conflict itself, relations within Islam on the one hand and between Islam and the West on the other. The latter part of the course will consider the sources of perceptual shift that led simultaneously to the narrowing of the conflict with the withdrawal of some of its participants (most Arab states) and its widening with the addition of Al Queada and Iran (via Hezbullah)."
1626,POL 399,The Co-operative Experience,"This course provides a significant work experience to support the professional development of the student and complement theoretical and classroom learning.

Case studies focus on movements in the areas of labor, civil rights, feminism, the environment, ""right wing politics"", and neighborhood activism.
In today’s world, social movements abound. Movements such as the Tea Party and the Occupy movements demonstrate that they can take place across the political spectrum of society. Moreover, the interconnectedness of the world economy creates social movements throughout the world, whether in Asia, the Mid-East or Europe that have direct affects on the United States. Because the coverage of these movements are given considerable media exposure, students (and the public) tend to accept the interpretations of these movements as presented in the narratives of the media coverage. This class will provide a systematic academic treatment of social movements.
Because social movements target structural and cultural institutions in society, the study of these movements will not only provide an understanding of these movements, but of larger social problems in society as well."
